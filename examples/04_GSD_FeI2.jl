# # 4. Generalized spin dynamics of FeI‚ÇÇ at finite *T*

# The [previous FeI‚ÇÇ tutorial](@ref "3. Multi-flavor spin wave simulations of
# FeI‚ÇÇ") used multi-flavor spin wave theory to calculate the dynamical spin
# structure factor. Here we perform an analogous calculation at finite
# temperature using the [classical dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent
# states](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.054423).
#
# Compared to spin wave theory, classical spin dynamics in real-space is
# typically much slower, and is limited in ``ùê™``-space resolution. The
# approach, however, allows for thermal fluctuations, can be used to explore
# [finite temperature phases](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014427), and
# enables the study of [highly non-equilibrium
# processes](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.235154).
#
# The structure of this tutorial largely follows our [previous study of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ
# at finite *T*](@ref "2. Landau-Lifshitz dynamics of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ at finite *T*").
# In practice, to switch from a dynamics of spin dipoles to a generalized
# dynamics of SU(3) coherent states, the user simply switches from `:dipole`
# mode to `:SUN` mode in the [`System`](@ref) constructor.
#
# Construct the FeI‚ÇÇ system as described in the [previous tutorial](@ref "3.
# Multi-flavor spin wave simulations of FeI‚ÇÇ").

# Here, we will instead use [`Langevin`](@ref) dynamics to relax the system into
# thermal equilibrium. The temperature 2.3 K ‚âà 0.2 meV is within the ordered
# phase, but large enough so that the dynamics can overcome local energy
# barriers and annihilate defects.
