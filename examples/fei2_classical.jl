# # Structure Factors with Classical Dynamics 

using Sunny, GLMakie#hide

# In our previous [Case Study: FeI$_{2}$](@ref), we used linear spin wave theory
# (LSWT) to calculate the dynamical structure factor. Here, we perform a similar
# calculation using classical spin dynamics. Because we are interested in the
# coupled dynamics of spin dipoles and quadrupoles, we employ a [classical
# dynamics of SU(3) coherent states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265) that
# generalizes the Landau-Lifshitz equation.
#
# Compared to LSWT, simulations using classical dynamics are much slower, and
# are limited in $k$-space resolution. However, they make it is possible to
# capture nonlinear effects associated with finite temperature fluctuations.
# Classical dynamics are also appealing for studying out-of-equilibrium systems
# (e.g., relaxation of spin glasses), or systems with quenched inhomogeneities
# that require large simulation volumes.
#
# In this tutorial, we show how to study the finite temperature dynamics of
# FeI$_2$ using the classical approach. It is important to stress that the
# estimation of ``S(ùê™,œâ)`` with classical dynamics is fundamentally a Monte
# Carlo calculation: sample spin configurations are drawn from thermal
# equilibrium and used as initial conditions for generating dissipationless
# trajectories. The correlations of these trajectories are then averaged and
# used to calculate scattering intensities. It is therefore important to ensure
# that the initial spin configurations are sampled appropriately and that
# sufficient statistics are collected. We will demonstrate one approach here.
#
# As an overview, we will:
#
# 1. Identify the ground state
# 2. Measure correlation data describing the excitations around that ground state
# 3. Use the correlation data to compute scattering intensities
#
# As the implementation of the FeI$_2$ model is already covered in detail in the
# LSWT tutorial, we will not repeat it below. Instead, we will assume that you
# already have defined a `sys` in the same way with lattice dimensions $4√ó4√ó4$.

# ## Finding a ground state

# Sunny uses the [Langevin dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent
# states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265) to sample spin configurations
# from the thermal equlibrium. One first constructs a
# [`Langevin`](@ref) integrator. This requires a time step, temperature, and a
# phenomenological damping parameter $Œª$ that sets the coupling to the thermal
# bath.

Œît = 0.05/D    # Should be inversely proportional to the largest energy scale
               ## in the system. For FeI2, this is the easy-axis anisotropy,
               ## `D = 2.165` (meV). The prefactor 0.05 is relatively small,
               ## and achieves high accuracy.
kT = 0.2       # Temperature of the thermal bath (meV).
Œª = 0.1        # This value is typically good for Monte Carlo sampling,
               ## independent of system details.

langevin = Langevin(Œît; kT, Œª);

# Sampling with a large number of Langevin time-steps should hopefully
# thermalize the system to a target temperature. For demonstration purposes, we
# will here run for a relatively short period of 1,000 timesteps.

end

# To inspect the structure of the spin configuration, we use the function
# [`minimize_energy!`](@ref) to find a nearby _local_ minimum. Then
# [`print_wrapped_intensities`](@ref) provides information about the Fourier
# modes in reciprocal lattice units (RLU).

# The wide distribution of intensities indicates an imperfect magnetic order.
# The defects are immediately apparent in the real-space spin configuration.

# In this case, we can find the correct ground state simply by running the
# Langevin dynamics for longer.

# This is the perfect single-$ùêê$ ground state. This worked because the
# temperature `kT = 0.2` was carefully selected. It is below the magnetic
# ordering temperature, but still large enough that the Langevin dynamics could
# quickly overcome local energy barriers. More complicated magnetic orderings
# will frequently require more sophisticated sampling schemes. One possibility
# is simulated annealing, where `kT` is slowly lowered over the course of the
# sampling procedure.

# ## Calculating Thermal-Averaged Correlations $\langle S^{\alpha\beta}(ùê™,œâ)\rangle$
#
# Now that we have identified an appropriate ground state, we will adjust
# the temperature so that the system still remains near the ground state, but still
# has thermal fluctuations.

kT = 3.5 * meV_per_K     # 3.5K ‚âà 0.30 meV
langevin.kT = kT;

# Additionally, since these classical simulations are conducted on a finite-sized lattice,
# obtaining acceptable resolution in momentum space requires the use of a larger
# system size. We resize the magnetic supercell to a much larger
# simulation volume, provided as multiples of the original unit cell.

sys_large = resize_supercell(sys, (16,16,4)) # 16x16x4 copies of the original unit cell
plot_spins(sys_large)

# As stressed above, we need to sample multiple spin configurations
# from the thermal equilibrium distribution.
# We therefore begin by using Langevin dynamics to
# bring the system into thermal equilibrium at the new temperature.

## At the new temperature
for _ in 1:10_000
    step!(sys_large, langevin)
end

# Now that we are in a state drawn from thermal equilibrium, we are ready to begin
# collecting correlation data ``S^{\alpha\beta}``.
#
# To collect one sample of spin-spin correlation data, we integrate the
# [Hamiltonian dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07563).
# This generates trajectories ``S^\alpha(\vec r,t)``.
# However, note that the spins are only defined at the finitely-many lattice
# sites, so ``\vec r`` is discrete.
# From the trajectories, Sunny computes fourier-transformed correlations ``S^{\alpha\beta}(q,\omega)``,
# where ``q`` is discrete for the same reason.
#
# The correlation data from this sample is now ready to be averaged together with data
# from other samples to form the thermal average.
# Samples of correlation data are accumulated and averaged into a
# `SampledCorrelations`, which is initialized by calling
# [`dynamical_correlations`](@ref):

sc = dynamical_correlations(sys_large; Œît=2Œît, nœâ=120, œâmax=7.5)

# `dynamical_correlations` takes a `System`
# and three keyword parameters that determine the œâ information that will be
# available: an integration step size, the number of œâs to resolve, and the
# maximum œâ to resolve. For the time step, twice the value used for the Langevin
# integrator is usually a good choice.

# `sc` currently contains no data. The first sample can be accumulated into it by
# calling [`add_sample!`](@ref).

add_sample!(sc, sys_large)

# Additional samples can be added after re-sampling new 
# spin configurations from the thermal distribution.
# The new samples are generated in the same way as the first sample, by running
# the Langevin dynamics.
# The dynamics should be run long enough that consecutive samples are uncorrelated, or
# else the thermal average will converge only very slowly.

for _ in 1:2
    for _ in 1:1000               # Enough steps to decorrelate spins
        step!(sys_large, langevin)
    end
    add_sample!(sc, sys_large)    # Accumulate the sample into `sc`
end

# Now, `sc` has more samples included:

# ## Computing Scattering Intensities

# With the thermally-averaged correlation data ``\langle S^{\alpha\beta}(q,\omega)\rangle``
# in hand, we now need to specify how to extract a scattering intensity from this information.
# This is done by constructing an [`intensity_formula`](@ref).
# By way of example, we will use a formula which computes the trace of the structure
# factor and applies a classical-to-quantum temperature-dependent rescaling `kT`.

formula = intensity_formula(sc, :trace; kT = kT)

# Recall that ``\langle S^{\alpha\beta}(q,\omega)\rangle`` is only available at certain discrete
# ``q`` values, due to the finite lattice size.
# There are two basic approaches to handling this discreteness.
# The first approach is to interpolate between the available
# data using [`intensities_interpolated`](@ref). For example, we can plot single-$q$ slices
# at (0,0,0) and (œÄ,œÄ,œÄ) using this method:

qs = [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]
is = intensities_interpolated(sc, qs, formula; interpolation = :round)

œâs = available_energies(sc)
fig = lines(œâs, is[1,:]; axis=(xlabel="meV", ylabel="Intensity"), label="(0,0,0)")
lines!(œâs, is[2,:]; label="(œÄ,œÄ,œÄ)")
axislegend()
fig

# The resolution in energy can be improved by increasing `nœâ` (and decreasing `Œît`),
# and the general accuracy can be improved by collecting additional samples from the thermal
# equilibrium.
#
# For real calculations, one often wants to apply further corrections and more
# accurate formulas. Here, we apply [`FormFactor`](@ref) corrections appropriate
# for `Fe2` magnetic ions, and a dipole polarization correction `:perp`.

formfactors = [FormFactor("Fe2"; g_lande=3/2)]
new_formula = intensity_formula(sc, :perp; kT = kT, formfactors = formfactors)

# Frequently, one wants to extract energy intensities along lines that connect
# special wave vectors--a so-called "spaghetti plot". The function 
# [`reciprocal_space_path`](@ref) creates an appropriate horizontal axis for this plot
# by linearly sampling between provided $q$-points, with a given sample density.

points = [[0,   0, 0],  # List of wave vectors that define a path
          [1,   0, 0],
          [0,   1, 0],
          [1/2, 0, 0],
          [0,   1, 0],
          [0,   0, 0]] 
density = 40
path, xticks = reciprocal_space_path(cryst, points, density);

# Again using [`intensities_interpolated`](@ref), we can evaluate the (interpolated) intensity
# at each point on the `path`.
# Since scattering intensities are only available at a certain discrete ``(Q,\omega)``
# points, the intensity on the path can be calculated by interpolating between these
# discrete points:

is_interpolated = intensities_interpolated(sc, path, new_formula;
    interpolation = :linear,       # Interpolate between available wave vectors
);
## Add artificial broadening
is_interpolated_broadened = broaden_energy(sc, is, (œâ, œâ‚ÇÄ)->lorentzian(œâ-œâ‚ÇÄ, 0.05));

# The second approach to handle the discreteness of the data is to bin the intensity
# at the discrete points into the bins of a histogram.
# First, the five sub-histograms are set up using [`reciprocal_space_path_bins`](@ref) in
# analogy to `reciprocal_space_path`.

cut_width = 0.3
density = 15
paramsList, markers, ranges = reciprocal_space_path_bins(sc,points,density,cut_width);

# Then, the intensity data is computed using [`intensities_binned`](@ref) for each sub-histogram:

total_bins = ranges[end][end]
energy_bins = paramsList[1].numbins[4]
is_binned = zeros(Float64,total_bins,energy_bins)
integrated_kernel = integrated_lorentzian(0.05) # Lorentzian broadening
for k in eachindex(paramsList)
    bin_data, counts = intensities_binned(sc,paramsList[k], new_formula;
        integrated_kernel = integrated_kernel
    )
    is_binned[ranges[k],:] = bin_data[:,1,1,:] ./ counts[:,1,1,:]
