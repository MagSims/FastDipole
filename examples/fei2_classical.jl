# # Structure Factors with Classical Dynamics 

using Sunny, GLMakie#hide

# In our previous [Case Study: FeI$_{2}$](@ref), we used linear spin wave theory
# (LSWT) to calculate the dynamical structure factor. Here, we perform a similar
# calculation using classical spin dynamics. Because we are interested in the
# coupled dynamics of spin dipoles and quadrupoles, we must employ a [classical
# dynamics of SU(3) coherent states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265) that
# generalizes the Landau-Lifshitz equation.
#
# Compared to LSWT, simulations using classical dynamics are much slower, and
# are limited in $k$-space resolution. However, they make it is possible to
# capture nonlinear effects associated with finite temperature fluctuations.
# Classical dynamics are also appealing for studying out-of-equilibrium systems
# (e.g., relaxation of spin glasses), or systems with quenched inhomogeneities
# that require large simulation volumes.
#
# In this tutorial, we show how to study the finite temperature dynamics of
# FeI$_2$ using the classical approach. It is important to stress that the
# estimation of ``S(ùê™,œâ)`` with classical dynamics is fundamentally a Monte
# Carlo calculation: sample spin configurations are drawn from thermal
# equilibrium and used as initial conditions for generating a dissipationless
# trajectories. The correlations of these trajectories are then averaged and
# used to calculate the structure factor. It is therefore important to ensure
# that the initial spin configurations are sampled appropriately and that
# sufficient statistics are collected. We will demonstrate one approach here.
#
# As the implementation of the FeI$_2$ model is already covered in detail in the
# LSWT tutorial, we will not repeat it below. Instead, we will assume that you
# already have defined a `sys` in the same way with lattice dimensions $4√ó4√ó4$.

# ## Finding a ground state

# The [Langevin dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent
# states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265) can be used to sample spin
# configurations in thermal equlibrium. One first constructs a
# [`Langevin`](@ref) integrator. This requires a time step, temperature, and a
# phenomenological damping parameter $Œª$ that sets the coupling to the thermal
# bath.

Œît = 0.05/D    # A good rule of thumb is `Œît = 0.05/E‚ÇÄ`, where E‚ÇÄ is the
               ## largest energy scale in the system. In FeI2, this is the
               ## easy-axis anisotropy scale, `D = 2.165` (1/meV). 
kT = 0.2       # Temperature for spin fluctuations (meV).
Œª = 0.1        # A good value is 0.1, independent of system details.
langevin = Langevin(Œît; kT, Œª);

# Sampling with a large number of Langevin time-steps should hopefully
# thermalize the system to a target temperature. For demonstration purposes, we
# will here run for a relatively short period of 1,000 timesteps.

# To inspect the structure of the spin configuration, we use the function
# [`minimize_energy!`](@ref) to find a nearby _local_ minimum. Then
# [`print_wrapped_intensities`](@ref) provides information about the Fourier
# modes in reciprocal lattice units (RLU).

# The wide distribution of intensities indicates an imperfect magnetic order.
# The defects are immediately apparent in the real-space spin configuration.

# In this case, we can find the correct ground state simply by running the
# Langevin sampler for longer.

# This is the perfect single-$ùêê$ ground state. This worked because the
# temperature `kT = 0.2` was carefully selected. It is below the magnetic
# ordering temperature, but still large enough that the Langevin dynamics could
# quickly overcome local energy barriers. More complicated magnetic orderings
# will frequently require more sophisticated sampling schemes. One possibility
# is simulated annealing, where `kT` is slowly lowered over the course of the
# sampling procedure.

# # Calculating $S(ùê™,œâ)$

# Because classical simulations are conducted on a finite-sized lattice,
# obtaining acceptable resolution in momentum space requires the use of a larger
# system size. We can now resize the magnetic supercell to a much larger
# simulation volume, provided as multiples of the original unit cell.

# spin configurations. We therefore begin by using Langevin dynamics to

# To estimate the dynamic structure factor, we can collect spin-spin correlation
# data by first generating an initial condition at thermal equilibrium and then
# integrating the [Hamiltonian dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent
# states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07563). Samples are accumulated into a
# `SampledCorrelations`, which is initialized by calling
# [`dynamical_correlations`](@ref).  `dynamical_correlations` takes a `System`
# and three keyword parameters that determine the œâ information that will be
# available: an integration step size, the number of œâs to resolve, and the
# maximum œâ to resolve. For the time step, twice the value used for the Langevin
# integrator is usually a good choice.

sc = dynamical_correlations(sys_large; Œît=2Œît, nœâ=120, œâmax=7.5)

# `sc` currently contains no data. A sample can be accumulated into it by
# calling [`add_sample!`](@ref).

add_sample!(sc, sys_large)

# Additional samples can be added after generating new spin configurations,
# which will again be achieved by running the Langevin dynamics. It is important
# that enough steps are chosen so that the resulting samples are decorrelated.

end

# ## Accessing structure factor data

# The basic functions for accessing intensity data are [`intensities_interpolated`](@ref)
# and [`intensities_binned`](@ref). Both functions accept an [`intensity_formula`](@ref)
# to specify how to combine the correlations recorded in the `SampledCorrelations` into
# intensity data. By default, a formula computing the unpolarized intensity is used,
# but alternative formulas can be specified.
#
# By way of example, we will use a formula which computes the trace of the structure
# factor and applies a classical-to-quantum temperature-dependent rescaling `kT`.

formula = intensity_formula(sc, :trace; kT = kT)

# Using the formula, we plot single-$q$ slices at (0,0,0) and (œÄ,œÄ,œÄ):

qs_rlu = [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]

# To get smoother results, it will be necessary to collect many more statistics.
