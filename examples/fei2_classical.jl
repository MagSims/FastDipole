# # Using Classical Dynamics to Calcualte $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$.

using Sunny, GLMakie

# The FeI$_2$ tutorial shows how to use traditional linear spin wave theory to
# calculate dynamical information in Sunny. Here we show how similar information
# may be calculated using classical dynamics, specifically by employing a
# generalization of Landau-Lifshitz dynamics to coherent states of SU($3$). This
# approach is generallly computationally more expensive than the traditional
# approach, and it can only be performed for finite-sized systems. The classical
# approach nonetheless provides a number of complementary advantages: it is
# possible perform simulations at finite temperature while retaining
# nonlinearities; out-of-equilibrium behavior may be examined directly; and it
# is straightforward to incorporate inhomogenties, chemical or otherwise.  
#
# In this tutorial, we show how to calculate the finite temperature dynamics of
# FeI$_2$ using the classical approach. It is important to stress that
# estimating ``S(ùê™,œâ)`` with classical dynamics is fundamentally a Monte Carlo
# process: sample spin configurations are drawn from thermal equilibrium and
# used as initial conditions for generating a dissipationless trajectories. The
# correlations of these trajectories are then averaged and used to calculate the
# structure factor. It is therefore important to ensure that the initial spin
# configurations are sampled appropriately and that sufficient statistics are
# collected. We will demonstrate one approach here.
#
# As the implementation of FeI$_2$ is already covered in detail in the previous
# tutorial, we will not repeat it below. Instead, we will assume that you
# already have a $4\times 4\times 4$ `sys` available and proceed to the
# calculation.

# ## Finding a ground state
# 
# The [Langevin dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent
# states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265) can be used to sample spin
# configurations in thermal equlibrium. Begin by constructing a
# [`Langevin`](@ref) integrator.

Œît = 0.05/D    # Single-ion anisotropy is the strongest interaction, so 1/D is
               # a natural dynamical time-scale (in units with ƒß=1).
Œª = 0.1        # Dimensionless magnitude of coupling to thermal bath
langevin = Langevin(Œît; kT=0, Œª);

# Attempt to find a low-energy spin configuration by lowering the temperature kT
# from 2 to 0 using 20,000 Langevin time-steps.
randomize_spins!(sys)
for kT in range(2, 0, 20_000)
    langevin.kT = kT
    step!(sys, langevin)
end

# Because the quench was relatively fast, it is expected to find defects in the
# magnetic order. These can be visualized.

plot_spins(sys; arrowlength=2.5, linewidth=0.75, arrowsize=1.5)

# If we had used a slower annealing procedure, involving 100,000 or more
# Langevin time-steps, it would very likely find the correct ground state.
# Instead, for purposes of illustration, let's analyze the imperfect spin
# configuration currently stored in `sys`.
#
# An experimental probe of magnetic order order is the 'instantaneous' or
# 'static' structure factor intensity, available via
# [`instant_correlations`](@ref) and related functions. To infer periodicities
# of the magnetic supercell, however, it is sufficient to look at the structure
# factor weights of spin sublattices individually, _without_ phase averaging.
# This information is provided by [`print_wrapped_intensities`](@ref) (see the
# API documentation for a physical interpretation).

print_wrapped_intensities(sys)

# The above is consistent with known results. The zero-field energy-minimizing
# magnetic structure of FeI$_2$ is single-$q$. If annealing were perfect, then
# spontaneous symmetry breaking would select one of $¬±q = [0, -1/4, 1/4]$,
# $[1/4, 0, 1/4]$, or $[-1/4,1/4,1/4]$.

# Let's break the symmetry by hand. Given a list of $q$ modes, Sunny can suggest
# a magnetic supercell with appropriate periodicity. The result is printed in
# units of the crystal lattice vectors.

suggest_magnetic_supercell([[0, -1/4, 1/4]], sys.latsize)

# The function [`reshape_supercell`](@ref) allows an arbitrary reshaping of the
# system. After selecting the supercell geometry, it becomes much easier to find
# the energy-minimizing spin configuration.

sys_supercell = reshape_supercell(sys, [1 0 0; 0 1 -2; 0 1 2])

end

plot_spins(sys_supercell; arrowlength=2.5, linewidth=0.75, arrowsize=1.5)

# Instead of using Langevin integration to perform the final minimization, we
# could also have used [`minimize_energy`](@ref).

## Calculating ``S(ùê™,œâ)``
# Because classical simulations are conducted on a finite-sized lattice,
# obtaining acceptable resolution in momentum space requires the use of a larger
# system size. We can now resize the magnetic supercell to a much larger
# simulation volume, provided as multiples of the original unit cell.

sys_large = resize_supercell(sys_supercell, (16,16,4))
plot_spins(sys_large; arrowlength=2.5, linewidth=0.75, arrowsize=1.5)

# As stressed above, the calculation process depends on sampling equilibrium
# spin configurations. We therefore begin by using Langevin dynamics to
# thermalize the system to a target temperature.

kT = 3.5 * meV_per_K     # 3.5K in units of meV
langevin.kT = kT

end

# To estimate the dynamic structure factor, we can collect spin-spin correlation
# data by first generating an initial condition at thermal equilibrium and then
# integrating the [Hamiltonian dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent
# states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07563). Samples are accumulated into a
# `SampledCorrelations`, which is initialized by calling
# [`dynamical_correlations`](@ref).  `dynamical_correlations` takes a `System`
# and three keyword parameters that determine the œâ information that will be
# available: an integration step size, the number of œâs to resolve, and the
# maximum œâ to resolve. For the time step, twice the value used for the Langevin
# integrator is usually a good choice.

sc = dynamical_correlations(sys_large; Œît=2Œît, nœâ=120, œâmax=7.5)

# `sc` currently contains no data. A sample can be accumulated into it by
# calling [`add_sample!`](@ref).

add_sample!(sc, sys_large)

# Additional samples can be added after generating new spin configurations,
# which will again be achieved by running the Langevin dynamics. It is important
# that enough steps are chosen so that the resulting samples are decorrelated.

for _ in 1:2
    for _ in 1:1000               # Enough steps to decorrelate spins

end

# ## Accessing structure factor data 
# The basic functions for accessing intensity data are [`intensities_interpolated`](@ref)
# and [`intensities_binned`](@ref). Both functions accept an [`intensity_formula`](@ref)
# to specify how to combine the correlations recorded in the `SampledCorrelations` into
# intensity data. By default, a formula computing the unpolarized intensity is used,
# but alternative formulas can be specified.
#
# By way of example, we will use a formula which computes the trace of the structure
# factor and applies a classical-to-quantum temperature-dependent rescaling `kT`.

formula = intensity_formula(sc, :trace; kT = kT)

# Using the formula, we plot single-$q$ slices at (0,0,0) and (œÄ,œÄ,œÄ):

qs_rlu = [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]

# To get smoother results, it will be necessary to collect many more statistics.
#
# For real calculations, one often wants to apply further corrections and more

# for `Fe2` magnetic ions, and a dipole polarization correction `:perp`.
