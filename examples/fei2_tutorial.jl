# # Case Study: FeI$_{2}$
# 
# FeI$_2$ is an effective spin-1 material with strong single-ion anisotropy.
# Quadrupolar fluctuations give rise to a single-ion bound state that cannot be
# described by a dipole-only model. This tutorial illustrates how to use the
# classical dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent state to model the magnetic behavior in
# FeI$_2$. The original study was performed in [Bai et al., Nature Physics 17,
# 467‚Äì472 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1).

#
# The Fe atoms are arranged in stacked triangular layers. The effective spin
# interactions include various anisotropic exchange interactions, and a strong
# single-ion anisotropy:
# 
# ```math
# \mathcal{H}=\sum_{(i,j)} J^{\alpha\beta}_{ij} S^{\alpha}_i S^{\beta}_j - D\sum_i \left(S^z\right)^2
# ```
# 
# We will formulate this Hamiltonian in Sunny and then calculate its dynamic
# structure factor.
#
# Begin by importing `Sunny` and `GLMakie`, a plotting package.

# ## Crystals and symmetry analysis
# A [`Crystal`](@ref) describes the crystallographic unit cell and will usually
# be loaded from a `.cif` file. Here, we instead build a crystal by listing all
# atoms and their types.

a = b = 4.05012  # Lattice constants for triangular lattice
c = 6.75214      # Spacing in the z-direction

latvecs = lattice_vectors(a, b, c, 90, 90, 120) # A 3x3 matrix of lattice vectors that
                                                 ## define the conventional unit cell
positions = [[0,0,0], [1/3, 2/3, 1/4], [2/3, 1/3, 3/4]]  # Positions of atoms in fractions
                                                         ## of lattice vectors
types = ["Fe", "I", "I"]
FeI2 = Crystal(latvecs, positions; types)

# Observe that Sunny inferred the space group, 'P -3 m 1' (164) and labeled the
# atoms according to their point group symmetries.

#nb # An interactive viewer of the crystal and its bonds is available for Jupyter notebooks.
#nb view_crystal(FeI2, 8.0)

# Only the Fe atoms are magnetic, so we discard the I ions using
# [`subcrystal`](@ref).

cryst = subcrystal(FeI2, "Fe")

# Importantly, `cryst` retains the spacegroup symmetry of the full FeI$_2$
# crystal. This information will be used, for example, to propagate exchange
# interactions between symmetry-equivalent bonds.

# ## Spin systems
# To simulate a system of many spins, construct a [`System`](@ref).

sys = System(cryst, (4,4,4), [SpinInfo(1,S=1)], :SUN, seed=2)

# The system includes $4√ó4√ó4$ unit cells, i.e. 64 Fe atoms, each with spin
# $S=1$. The default $g$-factor is 2, but this could be overriden with an
# additional argument to [`SpinInfo`](@ref). Spin $S=1$ involves a superposition
# of $2S+1=3$ distinct angular momentum states. In `:SUN` mode, this
# superposition will be modeled using the formalism of SU(3) coherent states,
# which captures both dipolar and quadrupolar fluctuations. For the more
# traditional dipole dynamics, use `:dipole` mode instead.

# ## Interactions and anisotropies

# ### Symmetry analysis
# The next step is to add interactions to the system. The command
# [`print_symmetry_table`](@ref) shows all symmetry-allowed interactions up to a
# cutoff distance.

print_symmetry_table(cryst, 8.0)

# The allowed $g$-tensor is expressed as a 3√ó3 matrix in the free coefficients
# `A`, `B`, ... The allowed single-ion anisotropy is expressed as a linear
# combination of Stevens operators. The latter correspond to polynomials of the
# spin operators, as we will describe below.
# 
# The allowed exchange interactions are given as a 3√ó3 matrix for representative
# bonds. The notation `Bond(i, j, n)` indicates a bond between atom indices `i`
# and `j`, with cell offset `n`. In the general case, it will be necessary to
# associate atom indices with their positions in the unit cell; these can be
# viewed with `display(cryst)`. Note that the order of the pair $(i, j)$ is
# significant if the exchange tensor contains antisymmetric
# Dzyaloshinskii‚ÄìMoriya (DM) interactions.
# 
# In the case of FeI$_2$, `Bond(1, 1, [1,0,0])` is one of the 6 nearest-neighbor
# Fe-Fe bonds on a triangular lattice layer, and `Bond(1, 1, [0,0,1])` is an
# Fe-Fe bond between layers. 

# ### Assigning interactions and anisotropies

# The function [`set_exchange!`](@ref) assigns an exchange interaction to a
# bond, and will propagate the interaction to all symmetry-equivalent bonds in
# the unit cell. The FeI$_2$ interactions below follow [Bai et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1).

# # Calculating structure factor intensities

# In the remainder of this tutorial, we will examine Sunny's tools for
# calculating the dynamical structure factor using a generalization of linear
# spin wave theory that captures quasi-particle excitations that include coupled
# dipolar and quadrupolar fluctuations.
# 
# A review of the quantum theory is provided in https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7731.
# The same theory can alternatively be viewed as the quantization of a classical
# dynamics on SU(_N_) coherent states, https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14125.
# Although outside the scope of this tutorial, Sunny provides support for
# simulating the classical SU(_N_) spin dynamics via a [`Langevin`](@ref)
# equation that generalizes the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation,
# https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265. This Langevin equation can be used to study
# equilibrium thermal fluctuations of classical SU(_N_) coherent states, or
# their non-equilibrium dynamics. Examples of the latter include relaxation of a
# spin glass, or the driven-dissipative dynamics of topological magnetic
# textures. To learn more, see the other Sunny documentation examples.

# ## Finding the ground state

# Begin with a random configuration and use [`minimize_energy!`](@ref) to find a
# configuration of the SU(3) coherent states (i.e. spin dipoles and quadrupoles)
# that locally minimizes energy.

randomize_spins!(sys)
minimize_energy!(sys)

# The expected ground state for FeI$_2$ is an antiferrogmanetic striped phase
# with four-spin wavelength (two up, two down). Visualizing the actual spin
# state, however, may indicate that the optimization procedure got stuck in a
# local minimum with defects.

plot_spins(sys; arrowlength=2.5, linewidth=0.75, arrowsize=1.5)

# A better understanding of the magnetic ordering can often be obtained by
# moving to Fourier space. The 'instant' structure factor $ùíÆ(ùê™)$ is an
# experimental observable. To investigate $ùíÆ(ùê™)$ as true 3D data, Sunny
# provides [`instant_correlations`](@ref) and related functions. Here, however,
# we will use the lighter weight function [`print_wrapped_intensities`](@ref) to
# get a quick understanding of the periodicities present in the spin
# configuration.

print_wrapped_intensities(sys)

# The precise output may vary with Sunny version due to, e.g., accumulation of
# floating point roundoff effects. Very likely, however, the result will be
# approximately consistent with the known zero-field energy-minimizing magnetic
# structure of FeI$_2$, which is single-$Q$. Mathematically, spontaneous
# symmetry breaking should select one of $¬±Q = [0, -1/4, 1/4]$, $[1/4, 0, 1/4]$,
# or $[-1/4,1/4,1/4]$, associated with the three-fold rotational symmetry of the
# crystal spacegroup. In practice, however, one will frequently encounter
# competing "domains" associated with the three possible orientations of the
# ground state.

# If the desired ground state is already known, as with FeI$_2$, it could be
# entered by hand using [`polarize_spin!`](@ref). Alternatively, in the case of
# FeI$_2$, we could repeatedly employ the above randomization and minimization
# procedure until a defect-free configuration is found. Some systems will have
# more complicated ground states, which can be much more challenging to find.
# For this, Sunny provides experimental support for powerful simulated annealing
# via [parallel tempering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_tempering),
# but that is outside the scope of this tutorial.

# Here, let's break the three-fold symmetry of FeI$_2$ by hand. Given one or
# more desired $Q$ modes, Sunny can suggest a magnetic supercell with
# appropriate periodicity. Let's arbitrarily select one of the three possible
# ordering wavevectors, $Q = [0, -1/4, 1/4]$. Sunny suggest a corresponding
# magnetic supercell in units of the crystal lattice vectors.

suggest_magnetic_supercell([[0, -1/4, 1/4]], sys.latsize)

# The function [`reshape_geometry`](@ref) allows an arbitrary reshaping of the
# system's supercell. We select the supercell appropriate to the broken-symmetry
# ground-state, which makes optimization much easier.

# Visualization 

# ## Linear spin wave theory
#
# Now that we have found the ground state for a magnetic supercell, we can
# immediately proceed to perform zero-temperature calculations using linear spin
# wave theory. We begin by instantiating a `SpinWaveTheory` type using the
# supercell.

swt = SpinWaveTheory(sys_min);

# The dispersion relation can be calculated by providing `dispersion` with a
# `SpinWaveTheory` and a list of wave vectors. For each wave vector,
# `dispersion` will return a list of energies, one for each band. 
# Frequently one wants dispersion information along lines
# that connect special wave vectors. The function [`connected_path`](@ref)
# linearly samples between provided $q$-points, with a given sample density.

points = [[0,   0, 0],  # List of wave vectors that define a path
          [1,   0, 0],
          [0,   1, 0],
          [1/2, 0, 0],
          [0,   1, 0],
          [0,   0, 0]] 
labels = string.(points)
density = 600
path, markers = connected_path(swt, points, density);

# `dispersion` may now be called on the wave vectors along the generated path.
# Each column of the returned matrix corresponds to a different mode.

disp = dispersion(swt, path);

# In addition to the band energies ``\omega_i``, Sunny can calculate
# the inelastic neutron scattering intensity ``I(q,\omega_i(q))`` according to
# an [`intensity_formula`](@ref). The default formula applies a polarization correction ``(1 - Q\otimes Q)``.

formula = intensity_formula(swt; kernel = delta_function_kernel)

# The `delta_function_kernel` specifies that we want the energy and intensity of each
# band individually.

disp, intensity = intensities_bands(swt, path; formula = formula)

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1,1]; xlabel="ùê™", ylabel="Energy (meV)",

# For comparison with inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data, it's often
# appropriate to apply a lorentzian broadening to the bands.

Œ≥ = 0.05 # Lorentzian broadening parameter
broadened_formula = intensity_formula(swt; kernel = lorentzian(Œ≥))

# The broadened intensity can be calculated for any ``(q,\omega)``
# using `intensities_broadened`:
energies = collect(0.0:0.01:7.5) # Energies to calculate
is = intensities_broadened(swt, path, energies, broadened_formula)

    ),

# The existence of a lower-energy, single-ion bound state is in qualitative
# agreement with the experimental data in [Bai et
# al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1) (Note that the publication
# figure uses a different coordinate system to label the same wave vectors and
# the experimental data necessarily averages over the three degenerate ground
# states.)

# ```

# The full data from the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) can be
# retrieved with the `dssf` function. Like `dispersion` and `intensities`,
# `dssf` takes an array of wave vectors.

disp, SŒ±Œ≤ = dssf(swt, [[0, 0, 0]]);

# `disp` is identical to the output that is obtained from `dispersion` and
# contains the energy of each mode at the specified wave vectors. `SŒ±Œ≤` contains
# a 3x3 matrix for each of these modes. The matrix elements of `SŒ±Œ≤` correspond
# to correlations of the different spin components (ordered x, y, z). For
# example, the full set of matrix elements for the first mode may be obtained as
# follows,

SŒ±Œ≤[1]

# and the `xx` matrix element is

SŒ±Œ≤[1][1,1]

# ## What's next?
#
# Sunny provides much more than just linear spin wave theory. Please explore the
# other examples in the documentation for more details. Sunny's capability to
# simulate the classical [`Langevin`](@ref) dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent states
# allows to incorporate finite-temperature spin fluctuations into the dynamical
# structure factor calculation, or to study systems under highly non-equilibrium
# conditions. Sunny also supports the construction of inhomogeneous systems
# (e.g., systems with quenched disorder) via [`to_inhomogeneous`](@ref).
