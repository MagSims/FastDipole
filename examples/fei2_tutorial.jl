# # Case Study: FeI$_{2}$
# 
# FeI$_2$ is an effective spin-1 material with strong single-ion anisotropy.
# Quadrupolar fluctuations give rise to a single-ion bound state that cannot be
# described by a dipole-only model. This tutorial illustrates how to use the
# linear spin wave theory of SU(3) coherent states (i.e. 2-flavor bosons) to
# model the magnetic behavior in FeI$_2$. The original study was performed in
# [Bai et al., Nature Physics 17, 467‚Äì472
# (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1).

#
# The Fe atoms are arranged in stacked triangular layers. The effective spin
# interactions include various anisotropic exchange interactions, and a strong
# single-ion anisotropy:
# 
# ```math
# \mathcal{H}=\sum_{(i,j)} J^{\alpha\beta}_{ij} S^{\alpha}_i S^{\beta}_j - D\sum_i \left(S^z\right)^2
# ```
# 
# We will formulate this Hamiltonian in Sunny and then calculate its dynamic
# structure factor.

# ## Get Julia and Sunny
# 
# Sunny is implemented in Julia. This is a relatively new programming language
# that allows for interactive development (like Python or Matlab) while also
# providing high numerical efficiency (like C++ or Fortran). New Julia users may
# wish to take a look at our [Getting Started with
# Julia](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/wiki/Getting-started-with-Julia)
# guide. Sunny requires Julia 1.9 or later.
#
# From the Julia prompt, load `Sunny`. For plotting, one can choose either
# `GLMakie` (a pop-up window) or `WGLMakie` (inline plots for a Jupyter notebook
# or VSCode).

using Sunny, GLMakie

# If these packages are not yet installed, Julia should offer to install them
# using its built-in package management system. If old versions are installed,
# you may need to update them to run this tutorial.

# ## Crystals
#
# A [`Crystal`](@ref) describes the crystallographic unit cell and will usually
# be loaded from a `.cif` file. Here, we instead build a crystal by listing all
# atoms and their types.

a = b = 4.05012  # Lattice constants for triangular lattice
c = 6.75214      # Spacing in the z-direction

latvecs = lattice_vectors(a, b, c, 90, 90, 120) # A 3x3 matrix of lattice vectors that
                                                ## define the conventional unit cell
positions = [[0, 0, 0], [1/3, 2/3, 1/4], [2/3, 1/3, 3/4]]  # Positions of atoms in fractions
                                                           ## of lattice vectors
types = ["Fe", "I", "I"]
FeI2 = Crystal(latvecs, positions; types)

# Observe that Sunny inferred the space group, 'P -3 m 1' (164) and labeled the
# atoms according to their point group symmetries.

# Only the Fe atoms are magnetic, so we discard the I ions using
# [`subcrystal`](@ref).

cryst = subcrystal(FeI2, "Fe")

# Observe that `cryst` retains the spacegroup symmetry of the full FeI$_2$
# crystal. This information will be used, for example, to propagate exchange
# interactions between symmetry-equivalent bonds.
#
# In a running Julia environment, the crystal can be viewed interactively using
# [`plot_crystal`](@ref).

plot_crystal(cryst, 8.0)

# ## Symmetry analysis
#
# The command [`print_symmetry_table`](@ref) provides a list of all the
# symmetry-allowed interactions up to a cutoff distance.

print_symmetry_table(cryst, 8.0)

# The allowed $g$-tensor is expressed as a 3√ó3 matrix in the free coefficients
# `A`, `B`, ... The allowed single-ion anisotropy is expressed as a linear
# combination of Stevens operators. The latter correspond to polynomials of the
# spin operators, as we will describe below.
# 
# The allowed exchange interactions are given as a 3√ó3 matrix for representative
# bonds. The notation `Bond(i, j, n)` indicates a bond between atom indices `i`
# and `j`, with cell offset `n`. In the general case, it will be necessary to
# associate atom indices with their positions in the unit cell; these can be
# viewed with `display(cryst)`. Note that the order of the pair $(i, j)$ is
# significant if the exchange tensor contains antisymmetric
# Dzyaloshinskii‚ÄìMoriya (DM) interactions.
# 
# In the case of FeI$_2$, `Bond(1, 1, [1,0,0])` is one of the 6 nearest-neighbor
# Fe-Fe bonds on a triangular lattice layer, and `Bond(1, 1, [0,0,1])` is an
# Fe-Fe bond between layers. 

# ## Building a spin System

# In constructing a spin [`System`](@ref), we must provide several additional
# details about the spins.

sys = System(cryst, (4,4,4), [SpinInfo(1, S=1, g=2)], :SUN, seed=2)

# This system includes $4√ó4√ó4$ unit cells, i.e. 64 Fe atoms, each with spin $S=1$
# and a $g$-factor of 2. Quantum mechanically, spin $S=1$ involves a
# superposition of $2S+1=3$ distinct angular momentum states. In `:SUN` mode,
# this superposition will be modeled explicitly using the formalism of SU(3)
# coherent states, which captures both dipolar and quadrupolar fluctuations. For
# the more traditional dipole dynamics, use `:dipole` mode instead.

# Next we will use [`set_exchange!`](@ref) to assign interaction to bonds. Sunny
# will automatically propagate each interaction to all symmetry-equivalent bonds
# in the unit cell. The FeI$_2$ interactions below follow [Bai et
# al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1).

# The function [`set_onsite_coupling!`](@ref) assigns a single-ion anisotropy
# operator. It can be constructed, e.g., from the matrices given by
# [`spin_operators`](@ref) or [`stevens_operators`](@ref). Here we construct an
# easy-axis anisotropy along the direction $\hat{z}$.

D = 2.165
S = spin_operators(sys, 1)
set_onsite_coupling!(sys, -D*S[3]^2, 1)

# Any anisotropy operator can be converted to a linear combination of Stevens
# operators with [`print_stevens_expansion`](@ref).

# # Calculating structure factor intensities

# In the remainder of this tutorial, we will examine Sunny's tools for
# calculating the dynamical structure factor using a [multi-boson
# generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7731) of linear spin wave theory
# (LSWT). This theory describes non-interacting quasi-particle excitations that
# hybridize dipolar and quadrupolar modes.

# ## Finding the ground state

# Begin with a random configuration and use [`minimize_energy!`](@ref) to find a
# configuration of the SU(3) coherent states (i.e. spin dipoles and quadrupoles)
# that locally minimizes energy.

randomize_spins!(sys)
minimize_energy!(sys);

# The resulting configuration can be visualized using [`plot_spins`](@ref).

plot_spins(sys)

# The expected ground state for FeI$_2$ is an antiferrogmanetic striped phase
# with a period of four spins (two up, two down). Here, however, the system may
# be stuck in a local minimum with defects. The defects become easier to
# recognize if we color arrows by the z-component of spin.

plot_spins(sys; color=[s[3] for s in sys.dipoles])

# A better understanding of the magnetic ordering can often be obtained by
# moving to Fourier space. The 'instant' structure factor $ùíÆ(ùê™)$ is an
# experimental observable. To investigate $ùíÆ(ùê™)$ as true 3D data, Sunny
# provides [`instant_correlations`](@ref) and related functions. Here, however,
# we will use the lightweight function [`print_wrapped_intensities`](@ref) to
# get a quick understanding of the periodicities present in each sublattice of
# the spin configuration.

print_wrapped_intensities(sys)

# The precise output may vary with Sunny version due to, e.g., different
# floating point roundoff effects. Very likely, however, the result will be
# approximately consistent with the known zero-field energy-minimizing magnetic
# structure of FeI$_2$, which is single-$Q$. Mathematically, spontaneous
# symmetry breaking should select one of $¬±Q = [0, -1/4, 1/4]$, $[1/4, 0, 1/4]$,
# or $[-1/4,1/4,1/4]$, associated with the three-fold rotational symmetry of the
# crystal spacegroup. In practice, however, one will frequently encounter
# competing "domains" associated with the three possible orientations of the
# ground state.

# If the desired ground state is already known, as with FeI$_2$, it could be
# entered by hand using [`set_dipole!`](@ref). Alternatively, in the case of
# FeI$_2$, we could repeatedly employ the above randomization and minimization
# procedure until a defect-free configuration is found. Some systems will have
# more complicated ground states, which can be much more challenging to find.
# For this, Sunny provides experimental support for powerful simulated annealing
# via [parallel tempering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_tempering),
# but that is outside the scope of this tutorial.

# Here, let's break the three-fold symmetry of FeI$_2$ by hand. Given one or
# more desired $Q$ modes, Sunny can suggest a magnetic supercell with
# appropriate periodicity. Let's arbitrarily select one of the three possible
# ordering wavevectors, $Q = [0, -1/4, 1/4]$. Sunny suggest a corresponding
# magnetic supercell in units of the crystal lattice vectors.

suggest_magnetic_supercell([[0, -1/4, 1/4]], sys.latsize)

# The function [`reshape_supercell`](@ref) allows an arbitrary reshaping of the
# system's supercell. We select the supercell appropriate to the broken-symmetry
# ground-state, which makes optimization much easier.

sys_min = reshape_supercell(sys, [1 0 0; 0 1 -2; 0 1 2])
randomize_spins!(sys_min)
minimize_energy!(sys_min)

# Because the reshaped system size is small, some "ghost" spins up to a given
# distance can help with visualization.

plot_spins(sys_min; color=[s[3] for s in sys_min.dipoles], ghost_radius=12)

# ## Linear spin wave theory
#
# Now that we have found the ground state for a magnetic supercell, we can
# immediately proceed to perform zero-temperature calculations using linear spin
# wave theory. We begin by instantiating a `SpinWaveTheory` type using the
# supercell.

swt = SpinWaveTheory(sys_min)

# Select a sequence of wavevectors that will define a piecewise linear
# interpolation in reciprocal lattice units (RLU).

q_points = [[0,0,0], [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1/2,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,0]];

# The function [`reciprocal_space_path`](@ref) will linearly sample a `path`
# between the provided $q$-points with a given `density`. The `xticks` return
# value provides labels for use in plotting.

density = 50
path, xticks = reciprocal_space_path(cryst, q_points, density);

# The [`dispersion`](@ref) function defines the quasiparticle excitation
# energies $œâ_i(ùê™)$ for each point $ùê™$ along the reciprocal space path.

disp = dispersion(swt, path);

# In addition to the band energies $œâ_i(ùê™)$, Sunny can calculate the inelastic
# neutron scattering intensity $I_i(ùê™)$ for each band $i$ according to an
# [`intensity_formula`](@ref). We choose to apply a polarization correction
# $(1 - ùê™‚äóùê™)$ by setting the mode argument to `:perp`. Selecting
# `delta_function_kernel` specifies that we want the energy and intensity of
# each band individually.

formula = intensity_formula(swt, :perp; kernel=delta_function_kernel)

# The function [`intensities_bands`](@ref) uses linear spin wave theory to
# calculate both the dispersion and intensity data for the provided path.

disp, intensity = intensities_bands(swt, path, formula);

# These can be plotted in GLMakie.

# (The publication figure accidentally used a non-standard coordinate system to
# label the wave vectors.)
# 
# To get this agreement, the use of SU(3) coherent states is essential. In other
# words, we needed a theory of multi-flavored bosons. The lower band has large
# quadrupolar character, and arises from the strong easy-axis anisotropy of
# FeI$_2$. By setting `mode = :SUN`, the calculation captures this coupled
# dipole-quadrupole dynamics.
#
# An interesting exercise is to repeat the same study, but using `mode =
# :dipole` instead of `:SUN`. That alternative choice would constrain the
# coherent state dynamics to the space of dipoles only.

# The full dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) can be retrieved as a $3√ó3$
# matrix with the [`dssf`](@ref) function, for a given path of $ùê™$-vectors.

disp, is = dssf(swt, path);

# The first output `disp` is identical to that obtained from `dispersion`. The
# second output `is` contains a list of $3√ó3$ matrix of intensities. For
# example, `is[q,n][2,3]` yields the $(yÃÇ,zÃÇ)$ component of the structure factor
# intensity for `nth` mode at the `q`th wavevector in the `path`.

# ## What's next?
#
# The multi-boson linear spin wave theory, applied above, can be understood as
# the quantization of a certain generalization of the Landau-Lifshitz spin
# dynamics. Rather than dipoles, this dynamics takes places on the space of
# [SU(_N_) coherent states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14125).
#
# The full SU(_N_) coherent state dynamics, with appropriate quantum correction
# factors, can be useful to model finite temperature scattering data. In
# particular, it captures certain anharmonic effects due to thermal
# fluctuations. This is the subject of our [Structure Factors with Classical
# Dynamics](@ref) tutorial.
#
# The classical dynamics is also a good starting point to study non-equilibrium
# phenomena. Empirical noise and damping terms can be used to model [coupling to
# a thermal bath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265). This yields a Langevin
# dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent states. Our [CP$^2$ Skyrmion Quench](@ref)
# tutorial shows how this dynamics gives rise to the formation of novel
# topological defects in a temperature quench.
# 
# Relative to LSWT calculations, it can take much more time to estimate
# $\mathcal{S}(ùê™,œâ)$ intensities using classical dynamics simulation. See the
# [SunnyTutorials
# notebooks](https://nbviewer.org/github/SunnySuite/SunnyTutorials/tree/main/Tutorials/)
# for examples of "production-scale" simulations.
