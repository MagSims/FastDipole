# # Powder averaged CoRh$_2$O$_4$
#
# This tutorial illustrates the calculation of the powder-averaged structure
# factor by performing an orientational average. We consider a simple model of
# the diamond-cubic crystal CoRh$_2$O$_4$, with parameters extracted from [Ge et
# al., Phys. Rev. B 96, 064413](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.064413).

# Construct a diamond [`Crystal`](@ref) in the conventional (non-primitive)
# cubic unit cell. Sunny will populate all eight symmetry-equivalent sites when
# given the international spacegroup number 227 ("Fd-3m") and the appropriate
# setting. For this spacegroup, there are two conventional translations of the
# unit cell, and it is necessary to disambiguate through the `setting` keyword
# argument. (On your own: what happens if `setting` is omitted?)

# In a running Julia environment, the crystal can be viewed interactively using
# [`view_crystal`](@ref).

# Construct a [`System`](@ref) with an antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor
# interaction `J`. Because the diamond crystal is bipartite, the ground state
# will have unfrustrated N√©el order. Selecting `latsize=(1,1,1)` is sufficient
# because the ground state is periodic over each cubic unit cell. By passing an
# explicit `seed`, the system's random number generator will give repeatable
# results.

# The ground state is non-frustrated. Each spin should be exactly anti-aligned
# with its 4 nearest-neighbors, such that every bond contributes an energy of
# $-JS^2$. This gives an energy per site of $-2JS^2$. In this calculation, a
# factor of 1/2 is necessary to avoid double-counting the bonds. Given the small
# magnetic supercell (which includes only one unit cell), direct energy
# minimization is successful in finding the ground state.

# We can now estimate ``ùíÆ(ùê™,œâ)`` with [`SpinWaveTheory`](@ref) and
