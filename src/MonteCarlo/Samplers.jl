    propose_uniform

Function to propose a uniformly random spin update in the context of a
[`LocalSampler`](@ref). In `:dipole` mode, the result is a random three-vector
with appropriate normalization. In `:SUN` mode, the result is a random SU(_N_)
coherent state with appropriate normalization.

"""
    propose_flip

Function to propose pure spin flip updates in the context of a
[`LocalSampler`](@ref). Dipoles are flipped as ``ùê¨ ‚Üí -ùê¨``. SU(_N_) coherent
states are flipped using the time-reversal operator.
"""
propose_flip(sys::System{N}, site) where {N} = flip(getspin(sys, site))

"""
    propose_delta(magnitude)

Generate a proposal function that adds a Gaussian perturbation to the existing
spin state. In `:dipole` mode, the procedure is to first introduce a random
three-vector perturbation ``ùê¨‚Ä≤ = ùê¨ + |ùê¨| Œæ`` and then return the properly
normalized spin ``|ùê¨| (ùê¨‚Ä≤/|ùê¨‚Ä≤|)``. Each component of the random vector ``Œæ``
is Gaussian distributed with a standard deviation of `magnitude`; the latter is
dimensionless and typically smaller than one. 

In `:SUN` mode, the procedure is analogous, but now involving Gaussian
perturbations to each of the ``N`` complex components of an SU(_N_) coherent
state.

In the limit of very large `magnitude`, this function coincides with
[`propose_uniform`](@ref).

For use with [`LocalSampler`](@ref).

    LocalSampler(; kT, nsweeps=1.0, propose=propose_uniform)

Monte Carlo simulation involving Metropolis updates to individual spins. One
call to the [`step!`](@ref) function will perform `nsweeps` of MCMC sampling for
a provided [`System`](@ref). The default value of `1.0` means that `step!`
performs, on average, one trial update per spin.

Assuming ergodicity, the `LocalSampler` will sample from thermal equilibrium for
the target temperature `kT`. 

The trial spin updates are sampled using the `propose` function. Built-in
options include [`propose_uniform`](@ref), [`propose_flip`](@ref), and
[`propose_delta`](@ref). Multiple proposals can be mixed with the macro
[`@mix_proposals`](@ref).

The returned object stores fields `ŒîE` and `Œîs`, which represent the cumulative
change to the net energy and dipole, respectively.

An alternative approach to sampling is [`Langevin`](@ref), which may be
preferred for simulating continuous spins, especially in the presence of
long-range dipole-dipole interactions (cf. [`enable_dipole_dipole!`](@ref)).
