# Weighted average over variances to propagate error. This is essentially a
# "random phase" approximation, i.e., assumes the interference effects from
# phase averaging will average out. The weighting in the average comes from the
# form factors only. This approximation seems to give results very similar to
# those achieved by directly pulling out statistics during the sampling process.
# But it seems to me that the correct thing to do is simply to add all the
# variances from all the sites that contribute. Revisit this. This is currently
# not used, but would be employed in a parallel intensities-like pipeline for
# error propagation.
